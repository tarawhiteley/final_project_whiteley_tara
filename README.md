## Resources

I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

### Deductions
I have reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

#### Comments
- Again, my struggle is with making _concise_ commits.

- Also, I mistakenly jumped the gun and did significant work on this project before rereading the instructions and realizing I failed to clone the project. I added the missing files from the cloned directory to my project towards the end. I just wanted to explain why they weren't present in my "initial commit".
